# Cyberhoop for Android App
hacked together by Garth Dahlstrom based on the [[TarsosDSPAndroid|https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP]] codebase

This is app is a _very_ crude scoreboard for a Nerf Cyberhoop Basketball Hoop for Android, Nerf Hasbro only ever produced an iOS app, which while very cool, is now broken because they have not updated it not to crash in iOS 9. :(

The app works by listening for the "chirps" produced during the shot made sound when the hoop is in "App" mode and the arm sitting inside the hoop is depressed by a ball.

It is pretty reliable at recording buckets for the team "A" setting.
Team "B" setting works somewhat on an Honor 5X, but not at all on a Nexus 5

To install, you'll need to allow unknown sources, get the APK onto your phone (email it to yourself or something) and then install the APK.
